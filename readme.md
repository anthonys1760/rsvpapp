# RSVP App

This app was created as a tool to help event organizers allow guests to RSVP for parties and events. You can input the names of the people you want to invite to your even and thier name will show in a structured list. The Invitee's can also confirm if they will be able to attend your party or not by clicking on the the 'Confirm' box. They can also edit thier name if spelled incorrectly or remove thier name from the list as well. 

There is also a function that allows the organizer to hide those who havent responded to thier invitation from the list so other RSVP members cannot see.
